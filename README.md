# ECE264-Helper
Published test cases, as well as (TBD) an automated version of the checklist for submitting assignments

## TODO
* Implement some sort of settings you can set when initially using the tool to specify files to be submitted
* Look at other `*.c` files to see if they were changed (if not going to be submitted.
* Automate delete all `*.o` files and rebuild program (run `make`)
* Use `Makefile` to run through all test cases
* Use `valgrind` to check memory errors

## Contributing
To make a contribution, create a branch that states your tasks (e.g. `create-valgrind-check`). Make your commits, then submit a Pull request back to master.
