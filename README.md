# ECE264-Helper
Published test cases, as well as (TBD) an automated version of the checklist for submitting assignments

## TODO
* Implement some sort of settings you can set when initially using the tool to specify files to be submitted
* Look at other `*.c` files to see if they were changed (if not going to be submitted.
* Automate delete all `*.o` files and rebuild program (run `make`)
* Use `Makefile` to run through all test cases
* Use `valgrind` to check memory errors

## Contributing
To make a contribution, create a branch that states your tasks (e.g. `create-valgrind-check`). Make your commits, then submit a Pull request back to master.

## Forking 
Github is an open source platform, this means that everyone can make a contribution another person's repository. If you want to make a contribution you can fork this repository. Forking is giving yourself a copy of the orginal code. You can modify, change it, do what ever you want to it. You can also submit changes back to the original repository to let everyone else use your changes. You can do this by submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

To fork another repository look to the top right of the screen, press the fork button. Then select your own GitHub account. This will allow to edit your forked verison from your own account. Clone the repository just like how you cloned the ECE264 homework and you are good to go.
